# Conformal Mappings

Final project for the Spring 2024 APPM 4360: Complex Variables and Applications. Worked in a team of three to write and present a report on conformal mappings, focusing on the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. I wrote the the basic proofs for the key features of conformal maps and wrote the Mathematica code used to generate the images in the report and presentation.
